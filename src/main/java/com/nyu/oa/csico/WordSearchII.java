/**
 * You are given a grid (N X M) of letters, followed by a K number of words.The words may occur anywhere in the grid
 * in a row or a column, forward or backward. There are no diagonal words, however.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers - letters_rows and letters_cols, representing the
 * number of rows of the letter grid (N) and the number of columns of the letter grid(M):
 * The next N lines consist of M space-separated characters - letters, representing the letters of the grid;
 * The next line of the input consists of an integer - words_size, representing the number of words (K);
 * The next line of the input consists of K space-separated strings representing the words.
 * Output
 * Print space-separated strings "Yes" (without quotes) if the word is present in the grid. Otherwise, print "No" (without quotes).
 *
 * Note
 * The number of rows and columns are always the same as the letter grid.
 *
 * Example
 * Input:
 * 3 3
 * C A T
 * I D O
