/**
 * The arithmetic mean of N numbers is the sum of the numbers, divided by N.The mode of N numbers is the most frequently
 * occuring number. your program must output the mean and mode of a set of numbers.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input consists of an integer - inputArr_size, an integer representing the count of numbers in the given list.
 * The second line of the input consists of N space-separated real numbers -  inputArr representing the numbers of the given list.
 *
 * Output
 * Print two space-separated real numbers up-to two digits representing the mean and mode of a set of numbers.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 0 < inputArr_size < 10^3
 * -10^5 ≤ inputArr[i] ≤ 10^5; where i is representing the index of the inputArr.0 ≤ i < inputArr_size
 *
 * Note
 * '0' and negative numbers are valid inputs.lf more than one number has the same
 * frequency,then choose the smallest nuinber
