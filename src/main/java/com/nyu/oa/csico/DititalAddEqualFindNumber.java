 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input consists of an integer - numX, representing the input number (X).
 * The second line consists of an integer - numY, representing the number (Y).
 * Output
 * Print an integer representing the count of numbers whose digits adds up to Y for the given number X.
 * Constraints
 * 1≤X≤1000
 *
 * Example
 * Input
 * 20
 * 5
 * Output
 * 2
