/**
 * Consider a coding system where letters are represented as sequential decimal numbers starting from 0,
 * (i.e., a=O, b=1, c=2 .... z=25). Given a string of digits (e.g. "123") as input, print out the number of valid
 * interpretations of letters.
 *
 * Write an algorithm to calculate the number of valid interpretations of the letters formed by the given input.
 * Input
 * The first line of input consists of a string - decInput, representing the decimal numbers.
 * Output
 * Print an integer representing the number of valid interpretations for the letters formed by the given string of digits.
