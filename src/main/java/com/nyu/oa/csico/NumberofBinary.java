/**
 * Write a program to count the number of bit sets in a number.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input consists of an integer - numInput, for which bit sets are to be counted.
 * Output
 * Print an integer representing the count of bit sets in the entered number.
 *
 * Example
 * Input:18
 * Output:2
 * Explantation:
 * The binary of 18 is 10010.We calculate the number of 1's from the binary form, which is the bit set of that number.
 * The number of 1's in the binary form is 2.So,the output is 2.
