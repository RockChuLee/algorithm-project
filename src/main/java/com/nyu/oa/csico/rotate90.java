/**
 * Question
 * Write an algorithm to rotate the image by 90 degrees right.
 * lnput
 * The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers - matrix_rows and matrix_cols, representing the
 * number of rows of the matrix(N) and number of columns of the matrix(M);
 * The next N lines consist of M space-separated integers, representing the pixel of the matrix.
 * Output
 * Print M lines consist of N space-separated integers representing the rotated image by 90 degrees.
 * Example
 * Input:
 * 3 3
 * 123
 * 456
 * 789
 * output:
 * 741
 * 852
 * 963
