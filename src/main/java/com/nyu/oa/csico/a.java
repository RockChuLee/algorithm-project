Question
The current selected programming language is java. We emphasize the submission of a fully working
code over partially correct but efficient code. Once submitted, you cannot review this problem again. You can use System.out.println() to debug your code. The System.out.println() may not work in case of syntax/runtime error.The version of JDK being used is 1.8.

Note:The main class name must be "Solution".

In the hostel, there are birthday celebrations every month. Given N number of days which are representing the birthday, find the number of days where there are an odd number of birthday celebrations.

Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer - days_size representing the number of birthdays celebrations(N).
The second line of the input consists of N space-sparated integers - days, representing the birthdays' celebrations in a month.

Output
Print an integer representing the number of days where there is an odd number of birthday celebrations.

Constraints
0 ≤ days_size ≤ 10^3
0 < days[i] ≤ 31; Where i is representing the index of the days
0 ≤ i < days_size

Example
Input:
5
4 8 2 8 9
Output:
3
Explanation:
There are 5 numbers in this array. 4 has occurred once which is odd, so it meets the criteria, 8 doesn't as it has occurred twice, 2and 9 meet the criteria of occurring an odd number of times. So.the output is 3.
